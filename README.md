Vehicle transfer module
Creating a vehicle transfer module involves designing a system to manage the transfer of vehicles between drivers or entities. This typically includes managing records of transfers, validating transfers, and possibly handling associated data like vehicle and driver details. Below is a guide to help you set up a basic vehicle transfer module using a stack that includes TypeORM for database operations and Next.js for the frontend.

The database schema to include tables for vehicles, drivers, and transfers. Hereâ€™s an example using TypeORM entities.

    - Implemented a transfer page to facilitate transferring a vehicle from one driver to another.
    - Implemented a transfer history page to show the transfer history for each vehicle and its current status.
